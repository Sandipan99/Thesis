\section{Problem definition}
\label{prob_def}

We consider a graph stream $S$ represented by a set of edges $e_1$, $e_2$, $\cdots$ with each edge $e_i$ arriving at the 
$i^{th}$ (discrete) time step. A graph $G$ at time $t$ is the aggregate of all the edges arriving till time $t$. 
$V$ represents the set of unique nodes present in  $G$. The community structure of $G$ is represented by $C$. We consider $G$ to be both unweighted and undirected. 
%We further assume that the edges are unique and they arrive in an order $O$. 

%\subsection{Sampling problem}

\begin{mydef}
Given a streaming graph $G$ of size $V$, our objective is to obtain a sample graph $G_s$ of size $n$ 
 such that $C$, the underlying community structure of $G$ is highly preserved in $G_s$  $($i.e., $C \sim C_s$ where $C_s$ is the community structure of $G_s)$ given the constraint that any
algorithm at any discrete time step can only utilize the information of 
last arrived $\mathcal{H}$ ($<<$ $V$, $n$) nodes (which is maintained in a buffer).
