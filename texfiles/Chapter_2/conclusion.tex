The contributions of this chapter can be summarized as follows - 
\begin{itemize}
 \item we proposed \compas, a novel sampling algorithm for streaming graphs 
which is able to retain the community structure of the original graph.
 \item through rigorous experimentation on four real-world and one synthetic graphs we showed that our algorithm performs better than 
five state-of-the-art graph sampling algorithms.
 \item we further showed the effectiveness of \compas~ through two real-world applications
\end{itemize}
  
As an immediate future work we plan to analytically estimate the relation between sample size and the accuracy of our algorithm. 
It would also be interesting to investigate in detail the effectiveness of \compas~ in other real applications. 

%We also plan to check whether the present algorithm could be modified to estimate multiple graph properties. Finally we plan to extend our work to directed and weighted networks.
