\chapter[Related Work]{Related Work} In this chapter, we review relevant studies related to the objectives of this thesis. In specific, we concentrate on four separate directions. 
The first part deals with temporal networks in general, followed by a detailed description of the existing growth models. In the second part we review the existing sampling strategies for streaming graphs. 
%The following section is dedicated towards discussing information diffusion models in the context of temporal networks. 
Next we summarize information diffusion strategies in the context of temporal networks. 
Finally we look into the existing studies on peer-review system which we propose to improve on by applying temporal network analysis techniques.
