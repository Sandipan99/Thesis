\noindent To ensure efficient offload using WiFi network, we propose to use WiFi network as a local area CDN where popular files are distributed across the network in a local cache of WiFi APs. It ensures uninterrupted streaming service for users with high mobility. Another important contribution of this work is to propose a storage efficient spatial chunk distribution strategy considering human mobility model. Simulation results show that across a wide range of speed, system does a sizeable offload and in high traffic scenario performance degrades gracefully.\\



\noindent Traffic distribution across network is uneven. With such traffic distribution, ad-hoc association may result in poor system performance. To manage heterogeneity in load, we create a global view of load distribution across network. Moreover, we reduce pressing association control protocol to classical max flow algorithm which ensures maximum device association with knowledge of load distribution. Simulation results show that our proposed protocol can accommodate more devices and provide better fairness in association compared to existing protocols.\\



\noindent As people do share their subscription credential with others, service providers lose their revenue and extra traffic is also introduced into already congested network. In this work, we propose an authentication scheme utilizing our daily activities which reduces shareability substantially. We have chosen a set of daily activities, which users are uncomfortable to share with others, to form authentication challenge. Simulation results show that an authentic user can successfully authenticate in $95\%$ cases while even very close friends can not break-in in more than $5.5\%$ cases.\\
