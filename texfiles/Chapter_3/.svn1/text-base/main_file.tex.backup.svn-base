address our first objective of {???} ??.

\section{Introduction}
Community detection algorithms primarily deal with identifying densely-connected units from within large networks. Often this is done
blindly without much attention being paid toward inferring whether the network {\em at all possesses a community structure}. Similarly, a
community detection algorithm targets for full coverage; in contrast, it should rather not include some of the nodes in any community. 
Modularity is a widely accepted metric for measuring the quality of community structure identified by various community detection
algorithms. However, a growing body of research have begun 
to explore the limitations of maximizing modularity for community identification and evaluation; three such limitations 
include -- resolution limit, degeneracy of solutions and asymptotic growth of the modularity value. To address this issue, we propose a new
vertex-based metric called
{\it permanence}, that can quantitatively give an estimate of the community-like structure of the network. The central idea of permanence is
based on the observation that the strength of membership of  a vertex to a community depends upon the  following two factors: (i) the
distribution of external connectivity of the vertex to individual communities and {\em not} the total external connectivity, and (ii) the 
strength of its internal connectivity and {\em not} just the total internal edges.   

The contributions of this chapter are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
 \item We define permanence for both disjoint and overlapping community structures. In contrast to the earlier literature where it is
assumed that the constituent nodes in a community have same intensity of belongingness, permanence measures the extent to which each
individual node is a part of the community.

\item  We show that permanence as compared to other standard measures, namely modularity, conductance and cut-ratio provides a more
accurate estimate of a derived community structure to the ground-truth community.

\item Permanence qualifies to be appropriately sensitive to perturbations in the network.

\item We demonstrate that the process of maximizing permanence produces meaningful  communities that concur with the ground-truth structure
of the networks more accurately than the modularity based and other approaches.

\item We also provide theoretical results to show that maximizing permanence can effectively reduce the limitations associated with
modularity maximization as well as can indirectly help in inferring the community quality of a network.
\end{itemize}

In this chapter, we discuss the permanence measure for disjoint and overlapping communities separately.
