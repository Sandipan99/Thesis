I would like to take this opportunity express my gratitude to everybody who have inspired me and contributed directly or indirectly in realizing this
thesis. My parents have been the greatest source of inspiration and strength throughout my life and without their support and sacrifice, this thesis would never have taken shape. I would also like to thank my elder brother who has been my mentor throughout my life.     

It is impossible to express my gratitude to my supervisors, Prof.
Animesh Mukherjee and Prof. Niloy Ganguly in a few words. The long discussions with them not only helped me in formulating the problems of this thesis, but
also helped me to understand the nuances of doing research. This thesis would never have been possible without their constant support and encouragement. 
I would like to thank Dr. Matteo Marsili (ICTP, Italy) and Dr. Tyll Krueger (Wroclaw University of Science and Technology) for their guidance and support. 
I would also like to thank the members of my DSC Prof. J. Mukhopadhyay, Prof. A. Basu, Prof. D. Mukhopadhyay and Prof. A. Mukherjee  who have enriched this thesis with their insights and suggestions. 

I consider myself very fortunate to have been part of Complex Network Research Group (CNeRG). At CNeRG I have had the pleasure of knowing Parantapa Bhattacharya, Abir Dey, Surjya Ghosh, Tanmoy Chakraborty, Suman Kalyan Maity, Soumajit Pramanik, Abhik Jana, Sankarshan Mridha, Abhijnan Chakraborty, Ankan Mullick, Satadal Sengupta, Rohit Verma, Madhumita Mallick, Rijula Kar, Amrit Krishna, Mayank Singh, Subhendu Khatuya, Soumya Sarkar and Kaustav Rudra. Life would not have been same without them. I should also thank Debojyoti Kundu who has been a great roommate and a close friend.     

Lastly, this long journey has not always been smooth but has revealed to me the joy of learning and my only desire is to pursue it for the rest of my life. 

%realize that it is not success or fame but the sheer joy of learning that drives me to work every morning and my only desire is to continue it for the rest of my life.
