In this chapter we address our fourth objective of leveraging the community information of networks in order to design different
applications.


\section{Introduction}
Community detection or clustering constitute a fundamental framework
in the development of various applied systems, e.g., search system, recommendation system etc. In this chapter we show how the citation
network and various types of community markings of this network can be leveraged to develop two applications.

The contributions of this chapter are threefold:
\begin{itemize}
 \item  We analyze the scientific dataset mentioned in Section \ref{sec:data} to understand the citation
growth of each paper after its publication. We discover that the pattern of citation growth can be clustered into at least six different
categories which are in contrast with the
earlier
observation that the citation profile of published articles in general follows a universal pattern. We further conduct a deeper
investigation of the papers in the different categories that leads us to deduce a series of conclusions about the 
characteristic properties of these categories.

\item In particular, we adopt a {\em stratified learning approach} for the prediction task, whereby, we propose a two-stage prediction
model for the task of future citation count prediction where we make use of the six categories of citation pattern that we observe.

\item Finally, we propose for the first time a framework for {\em faceted recommendation} of scientific articles, {\em FeRoSA} which apart
from ensuring quality retrieval of scientific articles for a particular query paper, also efficiently clusters the recommended papers into
different semantic categories (facets).

\end{itemize}
