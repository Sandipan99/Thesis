\section{Summary of this Chapter}
  


The lack of reliable ground-truth communities has made network community detection a very challenging task. In this chapter, we 
developed ground-truth overlapping communities of a directed paper-paper citation network that emerge from the natural
grouping of research papers in various fields of the computer science domain. We conduced a set of experiments to understand this network
and the community structure from diverse perspectives. We conclude by summarizing our main observations in this chapter as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Quite remarkably, for the last fifty years one observes a very robust behavior of the dynamics -- the field that is the
strongest contender of the field currently at the forefront almost surely emerges as the top ranked field after the transition.
  \item The key factors that keep a field at the forefront include the citations from the backup field, the inception of the
seminal papers and the existence of high-impact papers.
  \item Funding statistics obtained from NSF is in very good agreement with the results predicted by our method.
  \item Four indicative features quite efficiently unfold the extent of interdisciplinarity of a field that further help in building
the classification model.
  \item For already very interdisciplinary fields, such as Data Mining, the indicators may have a certain ``saturation'' effect
forcing it towards the core region of the computer science domain. 
  \item The average behavior of a researcher's career indicates that a researcher tends to adopt few research fields in her
entire research career, though she seems to prefer to work simultaneously on various fields.
 \item Researchers who have worked in many fields in their entire careers but remained confined in few fields in each time window
get high importance in terms of citations compared to the others. 
 \end{itemize}
