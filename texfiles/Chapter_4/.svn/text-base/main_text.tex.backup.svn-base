\chapter[Community-based Applications]{Community-based Applications} In this chapter, we
address our fourth objective of leveraging the community information of networks in order to designing different applications.

\section{Introduction}
 Community detection algorithms and clustering
functions provide a powerful tool to analyze the effect of various real time systems such as search systems, recommender systems which
are built preliminary on the network structure. In this chapter, we provide two such systems that designed using citation network and its
inherent community structure. 

The contributions of this chapter are as threefold:
\begin{itemize}
 \item  we analyze the scientific dataset mentioned in Section \ref{sec:data} to understand the citation
growth of each paper after its publication. We discover six different citation patters/categories which are in contrast with the earlier
observation that the citation profile of published articles in general follows a universal pattern. We further conduct a deeper
investigation of the papers in different categories that leads us to deduce a series of conclusions to
characteristic features of these categories.

\item We adopt a {\em stratified learning approach} in the prediction task, whereby, we propose a two-stage prediction model -- in the first
stage,
the model maps a query paper into one of the six categories, and then in the second stage a regression module is run only on the
subpopulation corresponding to that category to predict the future citation count of the query paper.


\item Finally, we propose for the first time a framework of {\em faceted recommendation} for scientific articles, {\em FeRoSA} which apart
from ensuring quality retrieval of scientific articles for a particular query paper, also efficiently arranges the recommended papers into
different facets (categories).

\end{itemize}
