\section{Anomalous behavior}
\label{anomalies}
In the peer-review process each submission is assigned to an editor who in turn assigns one or more reviewers with the task of judging the quality of the contributions of the submitted paper. The reviewer submits a report to the editor who in turn takes the final decision as to accept or reject the paper based on the report. Therefore, the editors and the reviewers are the two important entities of the peer-review system and they are mainly responsible for ensuring that flawed research does not get into the literature while at the same time correctly identify impactful contributions for publication.  
 So in our setting we define the following two cases to be anomalous - \\
(i) Accepted papers having low citation (research wrongly judged as impactful). \\
(ii) Rejected papers having high citation (quality research wrongly judged as flawed). \\
In this section we look into the anomalous behavior of the two important entities of the peer-review process: (i) the editors and (ii) the reviewers.
