\section{Summary of this Chapter}
  
In this chapter, we utilize the citation network and the community structure together to build
real applications. The contributions of this chapter are as follows. 
\begin{itemize}
\item The categorization of citation profiles offers a necessary first step
towards reformulating the existing quantifiers available in Scientometrics (e.g., impact factor) that should
leverage on the different categories of citation patterns in order to enhance their meaningfulness.

\item We further use the category information in a prediction system where the training samples are stratified to enhance the accuracy of
the predictions.

\item We also perform a semantic stratification of the data that further helps us designing FeRoSA which outperforms the baselines in
both faceted and flat
recommendations; in addition the recommendations per facets are also quite accurate.
\end{itemize}
