\section{Categorization of Scientific Citation Profiles }
\if{0}
Quantitative analysis in terms of counting, measuring, comparing quantities and analyzing measurements is perhaps the main tool to
understand
the impact of science. With the progress of time, scientific research itself by recording and communicating research results through scientific
publications, has become enormous and complex. The complexity has become so specialized that individual understanding and experience are no
longer sufficient to unfold trends or for making crucial decisions. Therefore, an exhaustive
analysis of research outputs in terms of scientific publications is of great interest among scientific communities to be selective, 
to highlight significant or promising areas of research, and to manage better investigation in science \cite{meho,
MacRoberts, Peritz, Boonchom2012220, Radicchi:2008p6887}. Bibliometrics (aka Scientometrics) \cite{Bensman, Vincent}, the application of
quantitative analysis
and statistics to publications such as
research
articles and their accompanying citation counts, turns out to be the main tool for such quantitative analysis. From the pioneering
research of Eugene Garfield \cite{garfield}, the use of citation analysis in bibliographic research serves as the fundamental quantifier to
evaluate the contribution of researchers and research outcomes. According to Garfield \cite{garfield}, a citation is nothing but the means
to
(i) pay homage to pioneers, (ii) give credit for related work (homage to peers), (iii) identify methodology, equipment etc., (iv)
provide background reading, (v) correct one's own work or the work of others and so on.

 There has been a plethora of research done on the citation network and on
its
evolution as a collective system. There is already a well-accepted belief on the dynamics of citations that a scientific article receives
after publication -- an
initial growth (growing phase) in the number of citations within the first two/three years after publication followed by a steady peak of
one to two years (saturation phase)
and then a final decline over the rest of the lifetime of the article (decline and obsolete phase) as shown in Fig. \ref{belief}
\cite{garfield1} . In most cases,
the above observation has been drawn from the analysis of a very limited set of publication data \cite{garfield_86, Abhaya}, thus,
obfuscating the true characteristics. Here, we conduct our experiment on a massive bibliographic dataset of the computer science domain
comprising more than 1.5 million papers published between 1970 and 2010 (see Section \ref{sec:data}).  Strikingly, unlike earlier
observations
about citation profile of a paper, we notice six different patterns of citation profiles prevalent in the dataset (namely, PeakInit,
PeakMul, PeakLate, MonDec, MonIncr and Oth). We exhaustively analyze these
profiles to exploit the micro-dynamics controlling the actual growth of the underlying citation network that has remained unexplored in the
existing literature. This categorization allows us to propose a holistic view of the growth of citation network through a dynamical
model that takes into account well-accepted preferential attachment \cite{Albert2002} along with the aging factor
\cite{RePEc:eee} of scientific articles in order to reproduce different citation profiles observed in the real-world dataset.
To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consider these two factors together in synthesizing the dynamic growth process of
citation profiles. 
We believe that this observation will not only help in reformulating the existing bibliographic indices such as Journal Impact Factor (JIF), but
will also enhance the general bibliometric research such as citation link prediction, information retrieval and
self-citation characterization.
