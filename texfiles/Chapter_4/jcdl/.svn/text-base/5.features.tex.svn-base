\section{Predicting Future Citations of Scientific Articles}

The next objective is to show that the categorization of citation profiles has significant consequences to early prediction of citation
itinerary of
scientific papers. Such a prediction scheme can be of significant interest not only for the scholars at universities and research institutes
but also for the engineers and policy makers in business and government domains. The very limited number of studies on this
topic~\cite{Yan:2011} have mostly modeled the problem as a learning task -- given a set of features and a particular time
interval, a regression model is trained on the entire set of the training population, and accordingly, the future citation count of a query
paper is estimated. A common underlying implicit assumption in these approaches is that the citation itinerary of all published papers have
similar characteristics. However, we observe that such an assumption is flawed and therefore seriously affects the accuracy of the
prediction. Consequently,
we propose to categorize the complete set of data samples into different subparts each of which corresponds to one of the six citation
itineraries
observed. This approach is commonly termed as {\em stratified learning}~\cite{NIPS2006_3015} in the literature where the members of the
stratified space are divided into homogeneous subgroups (aka strata) before sampling. This indeed reduces the extent of variability and
increases the representativeness of the data samples in each individual strata thus enhancing the learning scheme. 


\subsection{Distinctive Features}\label{sec:feature}
Here we provide a brief description of the set of features learned by the classifiers.
 The
features can be broadly
classified into three classes, namely the author-centric features, the venue-centric features and the paper-centric features. Note that for
a particular paper, all the features are calculated with respect to the year of its publication. 
For features which are still unobserved, e.g., new authors or new venues, we do not assign zero values; 
instead we set them to the minimum value observed across all the samples available at that particular time point.

\textbf{(i) Author-centric features:}
For all the author-centric features mentioned here, we measure both the
average ({\bf Avg}) and the maximum ({\bf Max}) values for each paper to incorporate the notion of both team-effect and individual leadership
respectively in the final citation count prediction. 

 {\bf(a) Author productivity:} 
%According to~\cite{bethard2010}, authors have tendencies to cite their own papers. 
Yan et al.~\cite{Yan:2011} noticed that the more papers an author
publishes (productivity of the author), the higher average citation counts she can expect.
Therefore, for each paper, we calculate the productivity of
its authors ({\bf ProAuth}) that indeed
indicates how the influence of productive authors regulates the citation profile of a paper.

{\bf(b) Author h-index:} H-index is a standard metric to measure both the productivity and the impact of the published work of an
author~\cite{hirsch2005}. Therefore for each paper, we measure the h-index ({\bf Hindex}) of authors.

{\bf(c) Author diversity:} The
diversity of an author $a$ denoted by {$AuthDiv(a)$}, indicating the breadth of expertise of $a$. It is measured by the entropy of
the research fields where she publishes and is given by 
\begin{equation}\label{div}
 AuthDiv(a)= -\sum_{i=1}^{24} p(n_i|n) \times log (p(n_i|n))
\end{equation}
where $n_i$ denotes the number of papers written by author $a$ belonging to the field $i$ (total 24 fields are available in the dataset),
and $n$ denotes the total number of papers written by $a$. For each paper, we include the diversity of authors ({\bf AuthDiv}) as a feature.
Note that these two
features have not been considered in earlier works \cite{Yan:2011}.

{\bf(d) Sociality of author:} Since the authors tend to cite papers of
their previous collaborators, it is natural to assume that the paper from a widely connected authors has a larger
probability to be
cited by different coauthors. A simple measurement is to count the number of coauthors ({\bf NOCA}) of each author present in a
paper~\cite{Yan:2011}.

\noindent{\bf(ii) Venue-centric features:}  
We consider the three features listed below to signify the importance of venue.

\noindent {\bf (a) Long term venue prestige:}  To measure the
prestige of a publication venue ({\bf VenPresL}), we calculate the average citations received by the papers published so far in that
venue.


{\bf (b) Short term venue prestige:} 
It is measured as the average number of citations received per paper published in that venue
during {\it at most} two preceding years ({\bf VenPresS}). The basic difference between {\bf VenPresL} and {\bf VenPresS} is that while the
former measures the overall impact of a venue by considering all the papers published so far in that venue, the latter only measures
the recent impact of the venue. {\bf VenPresS} is conceptually similar to the impact factor of a journal as defined in~\cite{garfield1}.

{\bf (c) Venue diversity:} {\bf VenDiv} can be measured by considering the different fields covered by the papers published in that venue. 
A formula similar to Equation~\ref{div} gives a quantitative measure of {\bf VenDiv}. This is another new feature
introduced in this study for the first time.

\noindent{\bf(iii) Paper-centric features:}
% We also investigate features directly related to a paper. The content of the paper, that is, the abstract and keywords of a paper, can
%also provide clues regarding its novelty. 
Among the paper-centric features mentioned below, third and fourth features are newly introduced in this study.

{\bf (a) Team-size:} It has been observed that there exists a critical value of team-size corresponding to
which
the citation accumulation is maximum. Hence, we directly take into account the number of authors of a paper ({\bf Team}).

{\bf (b) Reference count:} Sometimes, only the
number of references serves as a feature to distinguish regular and survey papers.
Therefore, we directly use the reference count of a paper ({\bf RefCount}) as a feature in our study.

{\bf (c) Reference diversity:} Earlier in Section \ref{index} we proposed a measure called Reference Diversity Index ({\bf RDI}) as an
indicator of interdisciplinarity that
attempts to quantify the diversity in terms of the number of fields being cited by a paper. It is also measured similarly using Equation
\ref{div}; here $n$ ($n_i$) indicates the total number of references (number of references to the papers belonging to field $i$).

{\bf (d) Keyword diversity:} As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:data}, MAS assigns keywords, from a global set of keywords, against each paper
in order to characterize it
properly. 
For each paper, we measure how diverse
its keywords are ({\bf KDI}) similarly by Equation~\ref{div}; here $n_i$
indicates the fraction of keywords of paper $x$ belonging to the field $i$.  
Note that a keyword may appear in multiple fields. For them,
we consider multiple instances one for each field. 

{\bf (e) Topic diversity:} 
We use the unsupervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation\footnote{We
use GibbsLDA++ (\url{ http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/}) with the default settings.} \cite{Blei:20037} as mentioned by Yan et
al.~\cite{Yan:2011} to discover topics for each paper. We
empirically set the number of topics as 100, i.e., for each of our 100 topics, the topic model calculates $p(topic_i|d)$, the inferred probability of topic $i$ in document $d$ ({\bf Topic}). The topic distribution $\tau(d)$ over all topics in the document $d$ is then:
 $\tau(d)=\{ p(topic_1|d),p(topic_2|d), . . . ,p(topic_{100}|d) \}$. 
 
 
%  Then we distribute the references of the article $R_T(d)$ according to the topic
% distribution ({\bf Topic}). To calculate the total reference counts of a
% particular topic from article $d$, denoted by $R_T(topic_i|d)$, we distribute the references of the article $R_T(d)$ according to the topic distribution $\tau(d)$, i.e., $R_T(topic_i|d) = R_T(d) \times p(topic_i|d)$, which again indicates how the idea of a given article is generated by the cross-fertilization of ideas from different topics. 
% %%PG: But why is R_T(d) important? You can get this idea from \tau(d) itself.
