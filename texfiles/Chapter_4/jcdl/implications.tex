\section{Publisher's views}
\label{implication}
We further requested the JHEP journal administrators to survey our findings. The publishers pointed out the following observations to be of great significance -- 
(i) that reviewers excessively accepting/rejecting often fail to judge correctly the quality of the article, could be useful in assigning referees;
(ii) the number of review request does not necessarily improve the quality of the article. This observation could help in improving the efficiency of the peer-review process since both cost and time are involved for each round of review request; 
(iii) since only $10\%$ of the submissions were assigned to multiple reviewers and in most cases they failed to reach consensus, the publishers felt the need to investigate this issue more deeply by having frequent multiple assignments henceforth; 
(iv) the framework for predicting the long-term impact of the paper would be extremely helpful in assisting the editors in taking decisions. This might also aid in tracking the performance of the referees;
(v) that a significant fraction of authors have high acceptance rate at JHEP indicates a presence of at least a weak bias in the peer-review process and hence needs to be investigated;
